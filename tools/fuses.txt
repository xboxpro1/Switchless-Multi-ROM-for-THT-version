The fuses that needs to be burnt differs a bit depending on which microcontroller is being used.
I have used the below fuses for ATmega328P but the same should be ok with 328 too.

ATmega328/ATmega328P
====================
Lfuse FF
Hfuse DE
Efuse FD

And for ATmega48A I have used the following which I think should be ok for all 48/88/168 variants except the PB variants

ATmega48/88/168
================
Lfuse FF
Hfuse DD
Efuse FE

This works for ATmega48PB. Haven't tried other PB variants.
ATmega48PB (88PB/328PB too?)
============================
Lfuse E7
Hfuse DD
Efuse FE
