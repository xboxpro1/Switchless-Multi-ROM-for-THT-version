# Switchless multi-kernal for C64 shortboard and C128

Can be used as a Kernal switch for the C64 shortboard motherboards and the C128. It has not been tested with C128CR/DCR but works well ion C128/C128D.
The Kernal menu is activated by pressing the RESTORE key for a few seconds (CBM+RESTORE for C64 part Kernal switch in a C128/C128D).
