I would like to thank RetroNynjah for the brilliant idea and excellent work.<br/>
After a long search on the internet, there is finally the perfect ROM switcher.

A switchless multi-ROM for 2364 ROM (24-pin) and 27128/27256 ROM (28-pin) type applications. <br/>
The switch is controlled by an MCU that is picking up predefined magic words on the data bus.  

Example use cases:
* Menu driven Kernal switch for Commodore VIC-20
* Menu driven Kernal switch for Commodore C64 (longboards)
* Menu driven Kernal switch for Commodore C64C (shortboard)
* Menu driven Kernal switch for Commodore C128
* You tell me


Check the General-Info.pdf for a general description and BOM.

Check the Application-Info.pdf in the applications folder for examples on how to use it for the use cases above.

Check the Hardware-Info.pdf in the hardware folder for a general technical description and build instructions.

A short video that shows how it works can be seen here.
