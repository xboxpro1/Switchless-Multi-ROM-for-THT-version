# Switchless Multi-ROM for 27128 & 27256 ROMs

<img src="rev4\images\pcb_render.png" alt="3D rendering" width="800"/><br/>

A switchless multi-ROM for 27128 and 27256 ROM (28-pin) type applications. The switch is controlled by an MCU that is picking up predefined magic words on the data bus.  
This is a more generic and further developed version of my previous 1541-II Multi-ROM design.

Example use cases:
* ROM switch for Commodore disk drives controlled by DOS commands.
* Menu driven Kernal switch for Commodore C64 (shortboards) and Commodore C128
* You tell me

Check the Applications folder for examples on how to use it for the use cases above.

Check the Technical Guide for a general technical description, build instructions and BOM.
